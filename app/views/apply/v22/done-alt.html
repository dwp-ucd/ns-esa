    <p class="govuk-body">You can self-certify for the first 7 days of your claim but after that you need to send us medical evidence. Your claim start date is <span class="new-date"></span>, so you need to send us medical evidence from <span class="new-date"></span> onwards.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Medical evidence always needs to be up-to-date, so send us a new one when it expires. You need to keep doing this as long as you're unfit for work.</p> 
    
    <p class="govuk-body">You can send us a fit note (also called a sick note) using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note" target="_blank">Send Your Fit Note service (opens in new tab).</a></p>
